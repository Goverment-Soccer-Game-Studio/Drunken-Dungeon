# Drunken Dungeon

Drunken Dungeon is an FPS Beat 'Em Up game where you drink to power yourself up. Navigate through a haunted dungeon and battle against spirits, skeletons, and other baddies as you drink your sorrows away. The more you drink, the stronger you become, but bewareâ€”the effects can also hinder your ability to fight!

## Project Overview

Drunken Dungeon was developed using **Unity Version 2022.3.1f** and leverages both 3D assets and dynamic game mechanics to create an engaging and challenging experience. The game is designed to provide a unique twist on the traditional FPS genre, combining combat mechanics with a strategic drinking system that affects gameplay.

### Primary Features
- **Unique Combat System**: Fight various enemies such as spirits, skeletons, and other dungeon creatures.
- **Drinking Mechanic**: Drink to enhance your abilities and stats temporarily, but be mindful of the consequences.
- **Variety of Enemies**: Encounter different types of enemies, each with unique abilities and strategies.
- **Immersive Dungeon Environment**: Explore a dark, atmospheric dungeon filled with secrets and challenges.

### Technologies Used
- **Unity 2022.3.1f**: Game engine used for development.
- **C#**: Primary programming language for game logic and mechanics.
- **Blender**: For 3D modeling and animation of game assets.
- **Adobe Photoshop/GIMP**: For creating textures and sprites.

## Technical Details

Drunken Dungeon is built on a modular architecture, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance of game components.

### Key Components
- **Player Controller**: Manages player movement, drinking mechanics, and interaction with the game environment.
- **Enemy AI**: Controls the behavior of various enemy types, including their attack patterns and movement.
- **Game Manager**: Oversees the game state, manages levels, and handles scoring and achievements.
- **Drinking System**: A unique mechanic that alters player stats and abilities based on the amount of alcohol consumed, introducing a strategic element to gameplay.

### Technical Challenges
One of the main challenges was implementing the drinking mechanic in a way that felt balanced and fun. We overcame this by creating a dynamic system that adjusts the player's abilities in real-time based on their intoxication level. This involved fine-tuning various parameters to ensure a fair challenge for players of different skill levels.
